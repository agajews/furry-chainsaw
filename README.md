## Mood Detection -- Finding friends when you need them

When we are depressed or feeling sad, talking to a friend is often the best way to find our center. However,
	1) People often underestimate just how bad they're feeling
	2) It's really hard to actively reach out for help, *especially* when we need it the most

So we decided to fix both of these problems by leveraged background data to detect when someone is feeling down, and we'll automatically notify a friend so they can check in and make sure everything is okay.

Our app currently uses the following data:
* Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
* Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Posts (Facebook, Twitter)


Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the variation in time interval between heartbeats. Studies have shown that decreased HRV linearly correlates with a higher chance of depression or states of high emotional stress.
